Have you ever heard of a tale so sly,
Of secrets hidden in verses high?
A whispered cipher, a rhyme obscure,
Words that echo, silent yet sure.
You wander through lines, seeking the key,
Patterns concealed for those who see.
Could it be found, the lock of lore,
A code within, you’ve not cracked before?
About the stanzas, the letters play,
A dance of words to keep truth at bay.
Have you the courage, the sight so clear,
To unveil what’s buried so near?
Each phrase a puzzle, each line a clue,
The poem waits – it speaks to you.
And once you've solved the riddle's core,
A cipher unlocked, forevermore.
